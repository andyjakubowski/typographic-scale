        As I invested more time into learning programming, I was impressed by
        how much order there was to some seemingly complex parts. Programmers
        were presented with a lot of power coming from tools, packages, and
        plugins, all of these things worked together nicely. As long as you
        follow a bunch of rules, you get a lot of capability *and* retain
        control over the thing.

        >I envy designers working with physical materials. They know the
        material they work with, and manipulate it directly. As they experiment
        with the material, they immediately see what works and what doesn’t.</p

        But as the complexity of what is being designed grows, that direct
        contact with the product frequently goes away. People take on smaller,
        specialized roles, and work together to produce the final result.

        I really liked that. A perfect example was the Rack interface. Rack lets
        frameworks and web servers work together easily as long as they follow
        some basic rules set by Rack.

        I wanted to see what it would feel like to be able to edit the
        fundamental properties of a design at runtime. I wanted to see how that
        would affect my design process.
